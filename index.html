        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>The picture that you see is my late brother that passed away over a year ago.  We did everything together: fishing, hunting and making other people laugh.  We always had each other's backs, no matter what.  
        The day I got a phone call that he had passed in his sleep, a part of me died. Back in the ninety's I used to make salsa, but it got so popular that I couldn't keep up with the orders due 
        to my full-time job. Time went on and my brother and I had a booth at a flea market, which he gave up about a year later.  Even after that we still went fishing and called each other to 
        see how we were doing.  
        </p>
        <p>
        Then one day, out of the blue, I got the dreaded call from my sister that he had passed away.  Everyday after that just felt like there was something 
        missing.  I was missing my big brother, that I always looked up to, and let me tell you it's like a dark cloud that never goes away. I felt depressed. Then one day, a customer came into the flea market, 
        someone I have never met, and I introduced myself and welcomed him to the market as I always have. He told me he made Habanero and Jalapeno bread to sell, and I told him I used to make salsa and 
        he said, "Why did you ever quit?! God's giving you a talent!" He then told me that I should start making it again, to which I replied that I did not have the money at this time. After we finished out conversation, he left 
        the store and came back twenty minutes later with all the fresh ingredients I needed to make my salsa. I told him that he didn't have to do that, and he said, "Don't worry about it, start making salsa again."
        </p>
        <p>
        So, I took an old picture of my brother and, with the help of my daughter, made the design that you see.  He just looked like a madman, so I named it Madman salsa. I can definitely say that the dark cloud has left and 
        my brother is with me everyday.  Everytime I make salsa, It's like having him back here with me. The face you see on the packaging is the look that he had when he tasted something delicious. It makes me happy seeing that expression 
        in every one of my customers faces when they taste it for the first time. One day, I plan to open a food truck that I can make fresh tortilla chips and nacho served with the Madman Salsa. Most importantly, 
        I couldn't have done any of this without my awesome customers! Thank you so much!
